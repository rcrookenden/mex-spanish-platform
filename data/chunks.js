    meaning: 
      "Another chunk that shouldn't be translated literally.\n\n" +
      "Yep, this one has absolutely nothing to do with seeing! 👀\n\n" +
      "It's actually the Spanish version of 'to have to do with'.\n\n" +
      "And just like its English equivalent, you're often gonna hear it used with 'con + alguien/algo'!",
    explanation:
      "<strong>1. Clearing your name when someone's thrown you under the bus 🚌</strong>\n" +
      "No tiene nada que ver conmigo.\n" +
      "It's got nothing to do with me. 🙅‍♂️\n\n" +
      "<strong>2. Pointing out relevance/connection</strong>\n" +
      "Creo que tiene que ver con lo que dijiste ayer.\n" +
      "I think it's connected to what you said yesterday.\n\n" +
      "<strong>3. Asking why something is even being mentioned</strong>\n" +
      "¿Y eso qué tiene que ver?\n" +
      "What's that got to do with anything?",
    tone: 
      "No slang here, folks, this one's good ol' standard Spanish.\n\n" +
      "✅ Neutral and flexible!\n\n" +
      "✅ Feel free to use it with your boss, your suegra, or your wey.",
